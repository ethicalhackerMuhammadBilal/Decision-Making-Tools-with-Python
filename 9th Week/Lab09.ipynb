    "# Introduction to File Handling\n",
    "File handling is an essential part of any programming language. It allows:\n",
    "- Reading from and writing to files.\n",
    "- Data persistency by storing data in files.\n",
    "- Data exchange between different programs.\n",
    "- Various file formats like text, binary, CSV, JSON, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, file handling is done using built-in functions such as `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`. \n",
    "The `open()` function is used to open a file, and it returns a __file object__. The file object provides methods and attributes to interact with the file.\n"

    "- `r` Read only: The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "- `w` Write only: It truncates the file to zero length if it exists, and creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",

    "- `w+` Write and Read: It truncates the file to zero length if it exists, and creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "- `a+` Read and Append: The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. It creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
